# Paris for You

A personal Paris exploration guide for Ekta & Kartik, living in the 10th.

**Live at → https://ektasengar.github.io/paris/**

It answers one question every time you open it: *what is something interesting
we could do next?* Not an events listing — a ranked, weather-aware, date-aware
set of suggestions built around one home base in the 10th.

---

## How it works

Static site. No build step, no framework, no backend, no API keys, no accounts.
Three JavaScript files and some JSON.

```
index.html
css/style.css
js/
  state.js      what the site remembers about you (localStorage only)
  weather.js    Open-Meteo — no key, no account, coordinates rounded to the neighbourhood
  scoring.js    the ranking engine
  app.js        loading and rendering
data/
  events.json         time-sensitive; expires and is pruned automatically
  places.json         cafés, bakeries, markets, shops, museums, parks, classes
  itineraries.json    ready-made routes — the "start here, then walk there" layer
  daytrips.json       reachable from Gare du Nord / Gare de l'Est
  neighborhoods.json  all 20 arrondissement profiles
  quests.json         long-running exploration goals
scripts/
  refresh.mjs   prune + validate; run daily by CI
  images.mjs    resolve one openly-licensed photo per card
  serve.mjs     local preview server
```

### Photographs

Every card carries a picture from Wikimedia Commons, resolved at build time by
`scripts/images.mjs` and baked into the JSON as a plain URL — so the browser
makes no API call and nothing can rate-limit the page.

Small businesses rarely have a freely licensed photograph of their own. Rather
than fake it, those cards borrow a picture of the street or quarter they stand
on, and `imageSubject` records what is genuinely in the frame so the card can
say so in its credit line. Each card names the photographer and the licence.

Two things worth knowing before touching this:

- Only Commons-hosted files are accepted. Anything under `/wikipedia/<lang>/`
  is a local upload, which for museums and festivals is usually a non-free
  logo used under fair use — not ours to republish, and a poor picture anyway.
- Commons renders **only a fixed set of thumbnail widths** — 120, 250, 500,
  960, 1280, 1920. Any other width is a 400. Cards store the 500px variant and
  the browser picks from a `srcset` at render time.

```bash
node scripts/images.mjs           # fill in anything missing
node scripts/images.mjs --force   # re-resolve everything
node scripts/images.mjs --resize  # normalise widths, verifying each
```

### The ranking

Nothing is shown in file order. Every candidate is scored against:

- how far it is from the 10th (a good thing 15 minutes away beats a good
  thing an hour away)
- price, with free and cheap weighted up
- how soon it disappears — things ending within a week get pushed forward
- **today's actual weather**, per day: rain promotes covered passages,
  museums and workshops and demotes anything outdoors; a heatwave promotes
  indoor and evening plans
- **French public holidays** — on Assumption or 1 May the site will not send
  you to a bakery, because the bakery is shut
- season, for things that only make sense in spring or autumn
- intrinsic quality and how unlikely you are to find it yourself
- whether you have already been
- **what you have told it you like** — rate things and the labels you
  favour gradually get weighted up

### Freshness

Every event carries `source`, `url` and `lastVerified`. `scripts/refresh.mjs`
runs each morning via GitHub Actions and deletes anything whose `end` date has
passed, so an expired event cannot survive on the page. It also validates every
record and fails the build rather than shipping a broken one.

The evergreen half of the data — bakeries, parks, walks, day trips — does not
expire, which is why the site is still useful on a quiet week.

---

## Working on it

```bash
node scripts/serve.mjs      # http://localhost:4321
```

```bash
node scripts/refresh.mjs --check    # validate, change nothing
node scripts/refresh.mjs            # prune expired entries + validate
node scripts/refresh.mjs --links    # also check every source URL resolves
```

### Adding something

Add an object to the right file in `data/`. The fields that matter:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | unique, kebab-case |
| `title`, `emoji`, `why` | `why` is the important one — say why *they* would care, not what it is |
| `arr`, `area`, `minutesFromHome` | distance is estimated from the Canal Saint-Martin area |
| `price`, `priceNote` | `price` is a number for ranking; `priceNote` is what gets displayed |
| `start`, `end` | `YYYY-MM-DD`. Anything with a past `end` is deleted automatically |
| `days` | `[0-6]`, 0 = Sunday. Omit if it is open every day |
| `indoor`, `weatherSensitive`, `rainyDayPick` | drives the weather-aware ranking |
| `labels` | drives the badges — see `LABEL_TEXT` in `js/scoring.js` |
| `quality`, `uniqueness` | 1–5, the intrinsic half of the score |
| `url`, `source`, `lastVerified` | required on events |

Then run `node scripts/refresh.mjs --check` before committing.

### Automating collection

`scripts/refresh.mjs` deliberately prunes but does not invent. The extension
point is documented at the bottom of that file. The rule worth keeping: never
write an event without `url`, `source` and `lastVerified`, and resolve
aggregator listings back to the venue's own page before trusting a date.
Paris.fr publishes an open events feed at `opendata.paris.fr`, which is the
city's own data and needs no key.

## Privacy

No exact address is in this repository or sent anywhere. Distances are
estimated from the neighbourhood, and the weather request uses coordinates
rounded to two decimal places — roughly a kilometre. Ratings, saved places,
quest progress and your theme choice are stored in your browser's localStorage
and are never transmitted. There is no analytics, no tracking and no login.

## Appearance

Light by default, deliberately — it reads like paper and suits the thing better
than a dark interface. The site does **not** follow the operating system's dark
mode; the moon button in the header switches to a warm dark theme and the choice
is remembered. An inline script in `<head>` applies a saved dark preference
before first paint so it never flashes light on the way in.
